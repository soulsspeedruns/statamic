This is an overview of the current [Black Knight Halberd (BKH)](//darksouls.wikidot.com/black-knight-halberd) [Dark Souls Remastered](/ds1remaster) [No Wrong Warp](/ds1remaster/any-no-wrong-warp) route. Note, that this does not include any safety strategies for people learning the route.

## Example VODs

World Record by mintius (in fight 4 kings RTSR)

2nd Place by mhrz (fall damage 4 kings RTSR)

# Route Notes

**These notes diverge slightly from the routing taken by mintius. They suggest a different RTSR setup for 4 kings that does not rely on their attack patterns. This changes the late game boss order to Nito/Seath/BoC instead of Seath/Nito/BoC and dupes humanities for the shortcut in archives instead of on the NLR elevator.**
