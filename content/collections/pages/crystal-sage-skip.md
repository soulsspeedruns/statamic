**Crystal Sage Skip** is a skip in [**Dark Souls III**](https://soulsspeedruns.com/darksouls3) that skips the [**Crystal Sage**](https://soulsspeedruns.com/darksouls3/crystal-sage/) boss using a series of jumps near the exit fog gate of the boss arena. The first jump is to get onto the rubble pile and the second jump is to land on a small piece of wall which is the most precise part of the skip. When performing the second jump you may land inside the wall which you can quit out and return to the entrance of the boss arena.

- Time saved performing skip: `around 9 seconds` compared to instant soulmass.
- This skip is very precise and is generally not used.
- In [teardrop](https://soulsspeedruns.com/darksouls3/teardrop/) the same [pathing](https://youtu.be/A68Yi-hLcTc?t=4555) can be used to bypass crystal sage as well.
- The initial skip was found by [Induratize.](https://www.twitch.tv/induratize)
