## Rules

- The player **must use the Boss Rush mod** to complete this run. Downloading link and installing instructions / FAQ for the mod can be found **[HERE](//reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/6r7cdw/ds3_boss_rush_mod_beta_release/)**
- Timing rules: The Boss Rush mod uses a **separate in-game timer** which is shown **underneath the Estus Flask** in the quick menu.\
  The game must be set to English for the B3LYP Estus timer to clearly work in the hotbar.\
  The timer starts after you pick up the Ashen Estus which will also activate the mod. The timer stops once the player beats the final boss.\
  The time shown on the timer after will be the player's submission time: [Video example](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8PAFXlzcwg). Be sure to include this in your submission.
- There is no need to quit out and show the actual IGT in Load Game since the actual timer in the game itself still runs after the timer below the Estus stopped.

## Bosses

Any enemy that has a large health bar on the bottom of the screen when engaged in combat is considered a boss. Other enemies are not considered bosses by the Dark Souls community even if it may seem like they are because of their size.
