## General information

The video below shows the soulmass kill and all relevant spawns for the backup strat (All Bosses stats/upgrade) .
If you choose to use the bundle on the backup you can do 4 L1 at the start and 3 L1+R1 when Sage pops up again.
If you do not want to use bundle on soulmass you can do 8 L1.
