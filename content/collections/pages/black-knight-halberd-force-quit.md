This is an overview of the current [Black Knight Halberd (BKH)](//darksouls.wikidot.com/black-knight-halberd) [Dark Souls Remastered](/ds1remaster) [Any% Force Quit](/ds1remaster/any-force-quit) route. Note, that this does not include any safety strategies for people learning the route.

For a beginner it may be worth picking up the 1k soul on the way to Quelaag and duping it once you reach parish rather than trying to dupe a homeward bone. If you fail the wrong warp to parish where you use the bone you wouldn't be able to finish the run. This is noted as an alternative in the notes.
