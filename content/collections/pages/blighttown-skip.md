The **Blighttown Skip** is a [sequence break](/sequence-break) in [Dark Souls](/darksouls) that allows the player to skip the area [Blighttown](//darksouls.wikidot.com/blighttown) entirely by going out of bounds in New Londo Ruins and dropping down from above into the tunnel of Quelaag's Domain by abusing the [Fall Control Quitout](/darksouls/fall-control-quitout) mechanic. It was discovered by ImmersedCimp in September 2016. A faster version of Blighttown Skip using [ Area Transition Clipping](/darksouls/area-transition-clipping) was discovered in February 2019 by CapitaineToinon and Kahmul.
