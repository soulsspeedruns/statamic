The **Capra Skip** is a [sequence break](/sequence-break) in [Dark Souls](/darksouls) that allows the player to skip the door entrance to the Depths (and thus killing Capra to obtain the normally necessary key) by getting [Deathcam](/darksouls/deathcam) in lower Undead Burg.

The skip was found by Kahmul78 and CapitaineToinon in January 2017.
