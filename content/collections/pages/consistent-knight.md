**Consistent Knight** is the title given to the female knight NPC employed by the Forest Hunter covenant to guard the grave of Artorias in [Dark Souls](/darksouls). Is is given due to her high tendency to perform the exact attack needed to achieve the HP range to trigger RTSR (<20%) in many routes.
