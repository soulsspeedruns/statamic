The **Greatwood Skip** is a skip in [**Dark Souls III**](/darksouls3) which allows the player to spawn back up on top of the **Curserotted Greatwood** arena after the fight has ended from down into the pit
by quitting out the game after performing a timed jump outside the loading zone, giving the player exactly on a few frames to spawn back up top when the death message appears and loading the game back in.

- Greatwood Skip skips an additional warp from Firelink Shrine to the Undead Settlement bonfire.
- Time saved performing this skip: `8 seconds`
- The initial skip was found by [**LostFeather413**](//youtube.com/user/LostFeather413) and was later further developed by [**QttSix**](//youtube.com/channel/UCYyN9tPlLZWbzcsdqDjvVGA) and [**Distortion2**](//twitch.tv/distortion2).
- The skip works on all versions of the game.
