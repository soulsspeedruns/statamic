The **Ladder Skip** is a skip in [**Dark Souls III**](/darksouls3) which allows the player to perform a timed jump over a gap that separates the bridge to the capital tower and the platform holding the capital bonfire, skipping the dropdown into the tower and climbing the ladder to the platform entirely.

- Time saved performing this skip: `6 seconds`
- The skip works on all versions
